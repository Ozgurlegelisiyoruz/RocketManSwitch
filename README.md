# General summary of the project:
 We will go a long way with Jetpack. There will be obstacles on the way, there will be gold and the most important ones will be our switch and energy points. There are 3 different color energies same as in StackColors

The more energy the user collects, the more beneficial the bonuses he will receive in the last part of the game will be for him. The user will be able to reproduce the coins they collect at the end of the game.



# Game mechanics:🎮
Character control will be left, right with swipe (such as aquapark and stack colors) will have plenty of effects. We will be able to avoid obstacles by doing right and left and collect energies. The roads will be ivy like in the aquapark and it will not be a straight line as in the stack colors. There will be color changing stations such as stack colors in many parts of the map. Character sensitivity will be like in the waterpark.


# Win: 🏆
If the user gets to the point to get bonuses, he will win the game.



# 3D Model (I wrote this but I'm the only one): 
You won't bother making a model for the road, just a small cube seems like; 

If you model the area drawn in red for example, we will bend it on the Unity side and turn it into a collective path.Stack colors need the same character of the game and have a map texture and model suitable for the character.The Skooter and the Electric We'll Collect (you can think of it as gold or diamonds in hypercasual games) will be modeled.There are many games with 5 types of obstacles (Shortcut Run, etc.)
Fail:
If we hit obstacles or if we run out of energy, we will lose.


# Point System 💯
The point system is with coins.
